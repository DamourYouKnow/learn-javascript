# Hello, world!

The example below will output a **string** using `console.log()` 
when the `run` button is clicked. 

A **string** is simply a sequence of characters which can be defined by 
wrapping the characters with quotes. `"Hello, world!"` and `'JavaScript is fun!'` 
are both examples of strings. Notice how they can either be surrounded by 
double quotes (`""`) or single quotes (`''`).

The following code will output the string `"Hello, world!"`. Try it!

<div class="editor" source="hello_world.js"></div>
