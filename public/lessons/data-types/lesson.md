# Data Types

### Number

The `Number` type is used to represent a numerical value. This can either 
be an integer value such as `1`, `2`, or `-3` or it can be a decimal value 
such as `3.14` or `-1.23`.

### String

The `String` type holds a sequence of characters such as `"Hello, world!"` 
or `"JavaScript is fun!"`.

### Boolean

The `Boolean` type holds either a value of  either `true` or `false` and is 
useful for when we want our program to make decisions. We'll learn more about 
this later.

```js
for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
    console.log(x);
}
