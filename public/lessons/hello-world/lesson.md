# Hello, world!

## Introduction

The example code below will output a **string** using `console.log()` 
when the `run` button is clicked. 

A **string** is simply a sequence of characters which can be defined by 
wrapping the characters with quotes. `"Hello, world!"` and `'JavaScript is fun!'` 
are both examples of strings. Notice how strings can either be surrounded by 
double quotes (`""`) or single quotes (`''`).

The following code will output the string `"Hello, world!"`. Try it!

<div class="editor" source="hello_world.js"></div>

## Code statements and comments

JavaScript starts executing code statements in the order that they appear. 
Each statements in JavaScript ends with the `;` character. Later on, we will 
learn about the different types of statements that can be used to create 
functioning programs.

Comments can be included in code to provide additional details to the person 
reading the code. Comments are ignored during code execution and can be 
declared in two different ways.

Any text following `//` on the same line are inline comments. 
```js
// this is an inline comment.
```

Any text following `/*` and before `*/` are block comments.
```js
/*
This...

...is a block comment
*/
```

The following example will execute the two statements `console.log('Hello');` 
and `console.log('World!');` in the order that they are written:

<div class="editor" source="hello_world2.js"></div>

## Exercise

Throughout the different lessons, you will also be presented with different 
exercises. Your code will be evaluated against different criteria and you 
will be given immediate feedback.

This first exercise is simple. Change the **string** on the first line to 
`'I am learning JavaScript!'`

<div class="editor" source="exercise.js" tests="tests.js"></div>
