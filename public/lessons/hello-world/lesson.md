# Hello, world!

The example below will output a **string** using `console.log()` 
when the `run` button is clicked. 

A **string** is simply a sequence of characters which can be defined by 
wrapping the characters with quotes. `"Hello, world!"` and `'JavaScript is fun!'` 
are both examples of strings. Notice how they can either be surrounded by 
double quotes (`""`) or single quotes (`''`).

The following code will output the string `"Hello, world!"`. Try it!

<div class="editor" source="hello_world.js"></div>

## Exercise

Througout the different lessons, you will also be presented with different 
exercises. We will evaluate your code against different criteria and give 
you immediate feedback.

This first exercise is simple. Change the **string** on the first line to 
`'I am a programming wizard!'`

<div class="editor" source="exercise.js" tests="tests.js"></div>
